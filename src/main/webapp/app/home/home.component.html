      an account will be created with the e-mail address, in case the client is new and does not have one created. After the data is 
      registered, the consultation will be created at the time chosen by the client. He will receive, at the specified e-mail address, 
      a link to choose the account password. after that, he will be able to authenticate on the platform in order to be able to view the
